A responsive ecommerce website design built from scratch with Bootstrap. 

I began this project with the goal of creating a clean, user-friendly, elegant, and minimalist ecommerce website. I started by looking up ecommerce website designs on Awwwards and Behance to study popular and intuitive layouts for modern websites. 

I created a layout that incorporated designs from both ecommerce and magazine websites to give my website a high-end "feel", focusing on both product and brand lifestyle.
